## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting Started

The included `.html` page allows you to visualize how your Lemon Agent is using tools to solve a given task.

Just open the `.html` file (**no additional installation required**) and via `'Choose File'` select the `execution.log` file where all your Lemon Agent interactions are captured. You can find the log file at the root in `./data`.

As a result, you will be able to understand how frequently and in which workflow combination your tools are used.
