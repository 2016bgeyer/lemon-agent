**This is the technical readme to self-host the Lemon AI server. If you are looking for more information on the project itself please feel free to checkout our [üçã main repo](https://github.com/felixbrock/lemonai).**

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting Started

Per default Lemon AI works with a hosted server version. If you want to self-host the Lemon AI server instead please use the following guideline:

### 1. Prerequisites

Requires Node.js 18.x and above.

### 2. Installing

Install all necessary node modules:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Server

On Mac/Linux:

```bash
npm start
```

On Windows:

```bash
npm run start-win
```

The terminal should indicate that the server is running:

```bash
App running under pid XXXXX and listening on port: 1313 in production mode
```

### 4. Provide Server Domain to Lemon AI Client

To communicate with a self-hosted instance rather than Lemon AI's hosted one, you need to provide the server domain to the Lemon [AI Python client](https://github.com/felixbrock/lemonai). For this you need to provide the the optional `api_domain` argument when calling the `execute_workflow` function with Lemon AI:

```Python
...
execute_workflow(
    llm=model,
    prompt_string=prompt,
    api_domain='http://localhost:1313'
)
...
```
